   finance (DeFi) token for gaming networking and not a registered digital currency, 
   the team strongly recommends that citizens in areas with government bans on 
   cryptocurrencies do not purchase it because the team cannot ensure compliance 
   with established regulations within certain territories. Always make sure 
   that you comply with your local laws and regulations before you make any purchase.</p>
